\section{Pricing}

The site will be free to access.  As with most web sites on the Internet, it is very difficult to charge people for access.  Most people will not use the service if they have to directly pay to enter it.  It is time consuming and a hassle.  Once one user has a username/password to allow them access to the site, then there is nothing to stop them redistributing the credentials to others, so that they may use their account.

\section{Advertising Revenue}

Traditionally most web sites generate revenue through advertising or some kind of sponsorship. The adverts usually take the shape of a 'banner' advertisement along the top of the web page as shown in Figure \ref{fig:banner}.

Advertisers traditionally pay between US\$10 - US\$30 per thousand visitors who see the banner.  The most common way to arrange this is through a third party broker.  These brokers are in constant contact with companies wishing to advertise and publishers of web sites and act on behalf of the companies to fill the advertising requirements.  This benefits both parties as the advertisers have a large array of web sites that they can display the adverts on so that they get a wide audience, and that the advertisments are targeted at the most relevant viewers.  The publishers then have to just deal with one organization to sell their advertising space.

The advertising brokers also keep track of demographics of the sites in their stable so that they can target specific catagories of adverts at specific sites.  They can also give statistics back to the advertisers in terms of number of times the advertisment has been seen, at what times, and by whom. 

\subsection{Advertising Rates}
Two of the largest Online Advertising management companies are DoubleClick \cite{www:doubleclick} and Adforce \cite{www:adforce}.  According to DoubleClick UK's web site, they charge GBP 28 - 34 per thousand impressions (visitors that view the advert) for Technology and Internet sites depending on the site.  Large services such as DoubleClick require a site to guarantee at least a million impressions per month, however smaller contracts are available through other smaller brokers.

\subsection{In-House Advertising}
Although it is often simpler to outsource the selling of advertising space, there are benefits of selling directly to advertisers.  The obvious benefit is there is no 'middle man' taking a cut of the revenue.  However in our case there is a much bigger benefit: since we are a search engine we can tailor the adverts to the search terms.  For example, if a user typed in the query 'linux games' we could return a more appropriate advertisement with the results.  The user is more likely to be interested in an advert for a games reseller than, say, for a company selling programming books.  This means the user is more likely to click on the advertisement and look at the advertisers web site.  This kind of targeting is worth more to the advertiser and hence can be sold at a higher price.

\subsection{Other Revenue}
Other sources of revenue have also been investigated.  The main other viable revenue stream is via licensing out the back end of the search system to affiliate sites.  Say, for instance, a Value Added Reseller of some Open Source software wanted to provide a branded version of our archive/search site as part of their web site.  They could integrate some code into their web site that would allow visitors to their site to browse and search the archives of their product mailing lists.  The actual mailing lists would be held on our servers and that is where the searches would be performed, but the user would still appear to be at the VARs site.  The VAR would pay us a licensing fee dependant on the number of searches made per month.  This is how search engines such as Google are funded \cite{www:googprog}.
