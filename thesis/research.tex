\section {Existing Work}
There are several text indexing packages availible already in the
public domain which source code can be found for, these are detailed
below

\subsection{Glimpse}

\subsection{FreeWAIS}

\subsection{Swish-e}

\subsection{HTDig}

\subsection{MG-2}


\section{Indexing Methods}
There has been quite alot of previous research into the area of full
text indexing, most of employ one of the indexing methods mentioned
below

\subsection{Inverted Lists}
One of the most popular way of constructing an index is a structure
called an \emph{inverted file}.  The file contains an \emph{inverted
  list} for each distrinct word in the texts to be indexed.  Each list
contains pointers to occurances of that word in the main text.  This
is probably the most natural method for indexing text and closely
resembles the index in the back of a book.

\subsection{Signature Files}

\subsection{Bitslices}

\subsection{Suffix Tries}

\subsection{Brute Force Pattern Matching}
