  abstract =	 "In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a
                  large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of
                  the structure present in hypertext. Google is
                  designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and
                  produce much more satisfying search results than
                  existing systems. The prototype with a full text and
                  hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is
                  available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer
                  a search engine is a challenging task. Search
                  engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web
                  pages involving a comparable number of distinct
                  terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every
                  day. Despite the importance of large-scale search
                  engines on the web, very little academic research
                  has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid
                  advance in technology and web proliferation,
                  creating a web search engine today is very different
                  from three years ago. This paper provides an
                  in-depth description of our large-scale web search
                  engine --- the first such detailed public
                  description we know of to date. Apart from the
                  problems of scaling traditional search techniques to
                  data of this magnitude, there are new technical
                  challenges involved with using the additional
                  information present in hypertext to produce better
                  search results. This paper addresses this question
                  of how to build a practical large-scale system which
                  can exploit the additional information present in
                  hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to
                  effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext
                  collections where anyone can publish anything they
                  want.",

                  for text in documents, but retrieval is usually
                  limited to finding documents that contain a
                  specified Boolean pattern of words. Effective
                  retrieval requires that documents with similar
                  meanings be found through a process of plausible
                  inference. The simplest way of implementing this
                  retrieval process is to rank documents in order of
                  their probability of relevance. In this paper
                  techniques are described for implementing
                  probabilistic ranking strategies with sequential and

                  representatives and inverted files. The comparison

                  competitive (in terms of efficiency) with signature

                  algorithm suitable for use on databases of 1-1000
                  GB, resident on primary or secondary storage. The
                  algorithm is based on inverted indexes, and has two
                  advantages over a previously published parallel
                  algorithm for retrieval based on signature
                  files. First, it permits the employment of ranking
                  strategies which cannot be easily implemented using
                  signature files, specifically methods which depend
                  on document-term weighting. Second, it permits the
                  interactive searching of databases resident on
                  secondary storage. The algorithm is evaluated via a
                  mixture of analytic and simulation techniques, with
                  a particular focus on how cost-effectiveness and
                  efficiency change as the size of the database,
                  number of processors, and cost of memory are
                  altered. In particular, we find that if the ratio of
                  the number of processors and/or disks to the size of
                  the database is held constant, then the
                  cost-effectiveness of the resulting system remains
                  constant. Furthermore, for a given size of database,
                  there is a number of processors which optimizes
                  cost-effectiveness. Estimated response times are
                  also presented. Using these methods, it appears that
                  cost-effective interactive access to databases in
                  the 100-1000 GB range can be achieved using current

  abstract =	 {The task of an information retrieval system is to
                  identify documents that will satisfy a user's
                  information need. Effective fulfillment of this task
                  has long been an active area of research, leading to
                  sophisticated retrieval models for representing
                  information content in documents and queries and
                  measuring similarity between the two. The maturity
                  and proven effectiveness of these systems has
                  resulted in demand for increased capacity,
                  performance, scalability, and functionality,
                  especially as information retrieval is integrated
                  into more traditional database management
                  environments. In this dissertation we explore a
                  number of functionality and performance issues in
                  information retrieval. First, we consider creation
                  and modification of the document collection,
                  concentrating on management of the inverted file
                  index. An inverted file architecture based on a
                  persistent object store is described and
                  experimental results are presented for inverted file
                  creation and modification. Our architecture provides
                  performance that scales well with document
                  collection size and the database features supported
                  by the persistent object store provide many
                  solutions to issues that arise during integration of
                  information retrieval into more general database
                  environments. We then turn to query evaluation speed
                  and introduce a new optimization technique for
                  statistical ranking retrieval systems that support
                  structured queries. Experimental results from a
                  variety of query sets show that execution time can
                  be reduced by more than 50\% with no noticeable
                  impact on retrieval effectiveness, making these more
                  complex retrieval models attractive alternatives for
                  environments that demand high performance. }

  ABSTRACT =	 "Automatic keyphrase extraction is a promising area
                  for applied machine learning because keyphrases are
                  an important means for document summarization,
                  clustering, and topic search. Only a small minority
                  of documents have author-assigned keyphrases, and
                  manually assigning keyphrases to existing documents
                  is very laborious. Therefore, it is highly desirable
                  to automate the keyphrase extraction process. This
                  paper presents a simple procedure for keyphrase
                  extraction based on the naive Bayes learning scheme,
                  which is shown to perform comparably to the
                  state-of-the-art. It goes on to explain how the
                  performance of this procedure can be boosted by
                  automatically tailoring the extraction process to
                  the particular document collection at hand. Results
                  on a large collection of technical reports in
                  computer science show that the quality of the
                  extracted keyphrases improves significantly if
                  domain-specific information is exploited."

                  with digital libraries, but it is poorly supported
                  by standard search engines. They operate at the
                  wrong level, indexing words when people think in
                  terms of topics, and returning documents when people
                  want a broader view. As a result, users cannot
                  easily determine what is in a collection, how well a
                  particular topic is covered, or what kinds of
                  queries will provide useful results. We have built a
                  new kind of search engine, Keyphind, that is
                  explicitly designed to support
                  browsing. Automatically-extracted keyphrases form
                  the basic unit of both indexing and presentation,
                  allowing users to interact with the collection at
                  the level of topics and subjects rather than words
                  and documents. Keyphind displays the range of topics
                  in the collection, indicates coverage in each area,
                  and shows all ways a query can be extended. We
                  compared Keyphind to a traditional query engine in a
                  small usability study. Users reported that certain
                  kinds of browsing tasks were much easier with the
                  new interface, indicating that a keyphrase index
                  would be a useful supplement to existing search
                  tools. }

                  very small index in most cases 2-4 percent of the
                  size of the text and still allows very flexible
                  full-text retrieval including Boolean queries,
                  approximate matching (i.e., allowing misspel-ling),
                  and even searching for regular expressions. In a
                  sense, glimpse extends agrep to entire file systems,
                  while preserving most of its functionality and
                  simplicity. Query times are typically slower than
                  with inverted indexes, but they are still fast
                  enough for many applications. For example, it took 5
                  seconds of CPU time to find all 19 occurrences of
                  Usenix AND Winter in a file system containing 69MB
                  of text spanning 4300 files. Glimpse is particularly
                  designed for personal information, such as one's own
                  file system. The main characteristic of per-sonal
                  information is that it is non-uniform and includes
                  many types of documents. An information retrieval
                  sys-tem for personal information should support many
                  types of queries, flexible interaction, low
                  overhead, and cus-tomization, All these are
                  important features of glimpse. }

                  and challenging data management
                  requirements. Attempts have been made to satisfy
                  these requirements using traditional (e.g.,
                  relational) database management systems. Those
                  attempts, however, have produced rather discouraging
                  results. Instead, information retrieval systems
                  typically use custom data management facilities that
                  require significant development effort and usually
                  do not provide all of the services available from a
                  standard database management system. Advanced data
                  management systems, such as object-oriented database
                  management systems and persistent object stores,
                  offer a reasonable alternative to the two previous
                  approaches. We have taken an existing information
                  retrieval system (INQUERY) and substituted a
                  persistent object store (Mneme) for the portion of
                  the custom data management system that manages an
                  inverted file index. The result is an improvement in
                  performance and significant opportunities for the
                  information retrieval system to take advantage of
                  the standard data management services provided by
                  the persistent object store. We describe our
                  implementation, present performance results on a
                  variety of document collections, and discuss the

  abstract =	 { Full-text information retrieval systems have
                  traditionally been designed for archival
                  environments. They often provide little or no
                  support for adding new documents to an existing
                  document collection, requiring instead that the
                  entire collection be re-indexed. Modern
                  applications, such as information filtering, operate
                  in dynamic environments that require frequent
                  additions to document collections. We provide this
                  ability using a traditional inverted file index
                  built on top of a persistent object store. The data
                  management facilities of the persistent object store
                  are used to produce efficient incremental update of
                  the inverted lists. We describe our system and
                  present experimental results showing superior
                  incremental indexing and competitive query
                  processing performance. Keywords: full-text document
                  retrieval, incremental indexing, persistent object
                  store, performance}

                  Retrieval on Symmetric Multiprocessors},
  file =	 {europar98.pdf},
  year =	 {1998},
  abstract =	 {Web search engines, such as AltaVista and Infoseek,
                  handle tremendous loads by exploiting the
                  parallelism implicit in their tasks and using
                  symmetric multiprocessors to support their
                  services. The web searching problem that they solve
                  is a special case of the more general information
                  retrieval (IR) problem of locating documents
                  relevant to the information need of users. In this
                  paper, we investigate how to exploit a symmetric
                  multiprocessor to build high performance IR
                  servers. Although the problem can be solved by
                  throwing lots of CPU and disk resources at it, the
                  important questions are how much of which hardware
                  and what software structure is needed to effectively
                  exploit hardware resources. We have found, to our
                  surprise, that in some cases adding hardware
                  degrades performance rather than improves it. We
                  show that multiple threads are needed to fully
                  uti-lize hardware resources. Our investigation is
                  based on InQuery, a state-of-the-art full-text
                  information retrieval engine. }
